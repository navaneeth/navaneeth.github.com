I love Onam.
It is an amazing festival which all Keralites celeberates without caste and religion. Onam happens when the weather is at it&rsquo;s best. Right after monsoon rains, whole Kerala turns colorful to welcome Onam. This time is a celeberation for photography lovers.
I made the below image on the Onam day. The mix includes, Canon 7D MKII, 100-400L and flash in high speed sync. This image was made at a stunning location named Vallikkunnu,</article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/leh-ladakh-bike-trip/>We got Leh’d!</a></h1><time datetime=2017-07-06T14:37:36+0530 class=post-date>Thu, Jul 6, 2017</time>
Feel like getting out of here? I am game- let me grab the bike keys and a map of Himalayas. Why Himalayas? Well, because Himalayas has always fascinated me. I have read countless books on Himalayan travel and nerve cracking experiences people had.
This July (26th Jun 2017 to 5th July 2017), Anju and I took the courage and went for a Himalayan trip on a motorcycle.

Jackson just made my day!
Today, I had to make some changes to one of our API. The change was minor so I have added additional fields into my JSON response. I have also kept the old fields just to make the existing clients happy.
During testing, I figured out that the change breaks existing clients. I was surprised! The error was,

Early July, we started working with 2 ex-yahoo friends who had a nice product idea that they wanted to make it live. They had some screen designs on paper and clear cut vision on what the product should look like.
We started with the development, post a week of ideation and technical spikes, and guess what, we had MVP ready for a limited user release in less than 9 weeks and a full production version by the end of October.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/bringing-business-ideas-to-live-in-3-months/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/function-strdup-implicitly-converted-to-pointer/>Function strdup implicitly converted to pointer</a></h1><time datetime=2015-05-21T10:50:48+0530 class=post-date>Thu, May 21, 2015</time>
I was trying to make a debian package for libvarnam. Lot of work went into making the package ready. Debian has very strict rules about how the packaging should be done. Debian also marks few errors as fatal and which may require a code change to fix it. One of the errors I faced was the following:
Our automated build log filter detected the problem(s) above that will likely cause your package to segfault on architectures where the size of a pointer is greater than the size of an integer, such as ia64 and amd64.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/function-strdup-implicitly-converted-to-pointer/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/document.ready-handler-not-getting-fired-rails4/>document.ready() handler not getting fired Rails4</a></h1><time datetime=2014-11-18T12:55:32+0530 class=post-date>Tue, Nov 18, 2014</time>
Rails4 uses a gem called turbolinks which makes following links on the web application faster. This gem is added to the Gemfile by default when a new rails project is initialized. However, there are few side effects this can cause.
Consider the following JS, added into app/assets/javascripts/projects.js:
$(function () { $('#startDate').datetimepicker({ pickTime: false }); }); This looks alright, but won&rsquo;t work as expected.
When rails navigates to the page following a link, turbolink comes into picture and makes it faster by caching the JS contents.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/document.ready-handler-not-getting-fired-rails4/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/hiding-menu-when-clicking-outside-angularjs/>Hiding menu when clicking outside - AngularJS</a></h1><time datetime=2014-09-28T11:29:28+0530 class=post-date>Sun, Sep 28, 2014</time>
Assume you have a menu which looks like the following:
&lt;div class="right-menu" ng-click="toggleMenu($event);"> &lt;img src="img/RightMenuIcon.png" alt="" /> &lt;/div> &lt;div ng-show="menuOpened" class="menu-dropdown-right"> &lt;ul> &lt;li ng-hide="loggedIn" class="class">&lt;a href="#/authenticate">Login&lt;/a> &lt;/li> &lt;li ng-show="loggedIn" ng-click="logOut()">&lt;a href="#">Logout&lt;/a> &lt;/li> &lt;/ul> &lt;/div> When the div gets a click event, angular calls toggleMenu which toggles the menuOpened variable. Changing the value of this variable in turn makes the div show/hide.
To hide the menu when clicking outside of the div, we add a onclick handler to window object which checks the menuOpened variable and updates it if the menu is visible.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/hiding-menu-when-clicking-outside-angularjs/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/how-to-get-lintian-warnings-when-using-ubuntu/>how to get lintian warnings when using ubuntu</a></h1><time datetime=2014-03-23T13:00:00+0530 class=post-date>Sun, Mar 23, 2014</time>
Recently, I started to package libvarnam for Debian. I followed the debian packaging guidelines and successfully created a package. I am using Ubuntu instead of Debian to do the packaging. Since Ubuntu is based on Debian, packaging also has the same procedure.
Debian requires all the packages to be lintian clean. Lintian is a command line utility which checks for errors and standards violations in the package files. My package was lintian clean and I have uploaded it into the debian mentors page seeking for sponsors.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/how-to-get-lintian-warnings-when-using-ubuntu/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/channels-in-libuv/>Channels in libuv</a></h1><time datetime=2013-08-02T12:59:50+0530 class=post-date>Fri, Aug 2, 2013</time>
go programming language provides a very powerful synchronization mechanism called channels. Channels simplifies communication between threads and makes it very easy to send and receive data from go routines.
I always missed such functionalities when using libuv. libuv has uv async_send, but it can be used only to wakeup the event loop. In this post, we will implement channels in C using libuv. The idea is to implement a channel so that user can use it without worrying about manually doing the synchronization.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/channels-in-libuv/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/building-static-and-shared-libraries-using-cmake/>Building static and shared libraries using CMake</a></h1><time datetime=2013-07-28T13:02:25+0530 class=post-date>Sun, Jul 28, 2013</time>
Recently in libvarnam, I had to build a static and shared library from the same source files. This was much harder before CMake 2.8. From CMake 2.8.8, CMake has support for Object library which made it very simple.
Basic idea is to use add_library with OBJECT type. CMake will compile all the source files provided in this target and makes the object files for it. It won&rsquo;t create a temporary static library with all these object files.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/building-static-and-shared-libraries-using-cmake/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/how-to-use-individual-lines-pulled-from-stdin-in-the-middle-of-a-command-when-using-xargs/>How to use individual lines pulled from stdin in the middle of a command when using xargs</a></h1><time datetime=2013-02-28T12:59:50+0530 class=post-date>Thu, Feb 28, 2013</time>
xargs is very powerful commandline utility. Here is what Wikipedia says about xargs
xargs is a command on Unix and most Unix-like operating systems used to build and execute command lines from standard input
Most common use of xargs would be to do something like,
find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 rm Let us assume that you have a file with list of files to be downloaded from a website.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/how-to-use-individual-lines-pulled-from-stdin-in-the-middle-of-a-command-when-using-xargs/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/how-to-upload-files-when-testing-using-selenium-webdriver/>How to upload files when testing using Selenium Webdriver</a></h1><time datetime=2013-02-20T12:59:50+0530 class=post-date>Wed, Feb 20, 2013</time>
You can use the following code to set a file path to the file upload control.
WebElement file = driver.findElement(By.id("control_id")); file.sendKeys("/full/path/to/file"); You need to pass full path to the sendKeys() for it to work. Otherwise sendKeys() fails silently.</article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/is-thread-dot-sleep-evil/>Is Thread.Sleep() evil?</a></h1><time datetime=2013-02-19T12:59:50+0530 class=post-date>Tue, Feb 19, 2013</time>
If you search for this topic, you will find lots of information and many of them claiming Thread.Sleep() is evil. However, I think this evilness is mostly dependent on which context Thread.Sleep() is used.
You might have seen code like the below one.
while (!exit) { DoWork(); Thread.Sleep(10000); } This code example does some work and sleeps for 1 minute before does the job again.

.NET comes with pretty good interoperability options which would enable unmanaged code to be used from a managed environment. In C#, to call a function which is available in a DLL, PInvoke (Platform invocation service) can be used. Here is what MSDN says.
Platform Invocation Services (PInvoke) allows managed code to call unmanaged functions that are implemented in a DLL.
This is very helpful when you need to call some system functions from your C# application.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/working-with-native-code-in-csharp-easily-with-cplusplus-cli/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/simple-generic-and-dynamically-allocated-array-in-c/>Simple, generic and dynamically allocated array in C</a></h1><time datetime=2012-05-11T12:59:50+0530 class=post-date>Fri, May 11, 2012</time>
C is a very good language. I have been using for quite some time for my opensource project. The flexibility C offers is really good. But sometimes, lack of simple datastructures like a dynamically growing array will slow down the programmer. There are tons of implementation available online, but most of them are overcomplicated, got lot of dependencies or tough to understand and incorporate with your application. In this post, I present a simple array which grows dynamically, reuses the memory, supports any pointer type and easy to copy to your code base.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/simple-generic-and-dynamically-allocated-array-in-c/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/simple-egg-timer-on-linux-for-pomodoro-technique/>Simple egg timer on Linux for Pomodoro technique</a></h1><time datetime=2010-12-19T12:59:50+0530 class=post-date>Sun, Dec 19, 2010</time>

To implement pomodoro technique, you need a kitchen timer or egg timer. Since I use pomodoro for my programming work, I obviously don’t want to use a physical timer.

In this post, I will explain about creating a circular doubly linked list using C#. .NET framework provides a doubly linked list implementation in System.Collections.Generic.LinkedListclass . But this class is not providing the behavior of a circular linked list and it is very tough to extend for supporting circular linked list requirements.
In a normal doubly linked list, each node will have a link to its previous and next nodes. In a circular doubly linked list, tail node’s next node will be head and head node’s previous node will be tail.<div class=read-more-link><a href=/post/circular-linked-list-an-implementation-using-c-number/>Read More…</a></div></article><article class=post><h1 class=post-title><a href=https://navaneeth.github.io/post/what-great-net-developers-ought-to-know-net-interview-questions-and-answers-part1/>What Great .NET Developers Ought To Know (More .NET Interview Questions and Answers) – Part1</a></h1><time datetime=2009-08-13T12:59:50+0530 class=post-date>Thu, Aug 13, 2009</time>
