I love [Onam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam).

It is an amazing festival which all Keralites celeberates without caste and religion. Onam happens when the weather is at it's best. Right after monsoon rains, whole Kerala turns colorful to welcome Onam. This time is a celeberation for photography lovers.

I made the below image on the Onam day. The mix includes, Canon 7D MKII, 100-400L and flash in high speed sync. This image was made at a stunning location named [Vallikkunnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallikkunnu),
