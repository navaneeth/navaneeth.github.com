      <description>Rails4 uses a gem called turbolinks which makes following links on the web application faster. This gem is added to the Gemfile by default when a new rails project is initialized. However, there are few side effects this can cause.
Consider the following JS, added into app/assets/javascripts/projects.js:
$(function () { $(&#39;#startDate&#39;).datetimepicker({ pickTime: false }); });  This looks alright, but won&amp;rsquo;t work as expected.
When rails navigates to the page following a link, turbolink comes into picture and makes it faster by caching the JS contents.</description>
