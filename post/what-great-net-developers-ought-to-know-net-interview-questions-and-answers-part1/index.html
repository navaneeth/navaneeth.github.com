This part we will be seeing the first set of questions he has given under <em>Everyone who writes code</em> heading.</p><p><strong>Q) Describe the difference between a Thread and a Process?</strong></p><p>A Thread is a small unit of code in execution. A process is an instance of program which will have multiple threads running. A process can host multiple threads. Thread will always belong to a process. Communication between multiple processes are difficult but communication between threads is easy.</p><p><strong>Q) What is a Windows Service and how does its lifecycle differ from a “standard” EXE?</strong></p><p>Windows service is a long running program which can run without user interaction. It is used for applications that should work always, e.g: a HTTP server. Unlike standard EXE, a windows service can’t be started by double clicking the EXE. It should be installed on the system as a service using installutil tool. Service control manager manges a windows service by providing options to start/stop a service.</p><p>Like a standard EXE, windows services lifecycle also begins from the main method. After that it fires the event OnStart in which you can write code for starting a service.</p><p><strong>Q) What is the difference between an EXE and a DLL?</strong></p><p>A executable file(EXE) is ready to execute wherein a Dynamic Link Library(DLL) contains types and methods that can be used from a EXE. DLLs are not meant to be executed directly and it is very helpful to organize and isolate common code which can be used with multiple applications.</p><p>Finally, EXE will have an entry point. DLLs will not have an entry point and all it does is to expose the types and methods. The direct equivalent of a DLL in LINUX is Shared Libraries(SO).</p><p><strong>Q) What is strong-typing versus weak-typing? Which is preferred? Why?</strong></p><p>Strong-typing defines some restrictions on how operations are done when different data types are involved. Consider the following example</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span style=color:#66d9ef>int</span> a = <span style=color:#ae81ff>10</span>;
a = <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;You can&#39;t assign a string!&#34;</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Above code won’t compile as variable a is strongly-typed and it can hold only an integer value.</p><p>Weak-typing is just opposite of strong-typing. C# is a strongly-typed language. But since most of the types derives from System.Object, you can write like.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp><span style=color:#66d9ef>object</span> o = <span style=color:#ae81ff>10</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>This can be called as weak-typing. Of course, strong-typing is preferred over weak-typing. To understand why, consider the following example in which we have a collection of age.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp>ArrayList ages = <span style=color:#66d9ef>new</span> ArrayList();
ages.Add(<span style=color:#ae81ff>10</span>);
ages.Add(<span style=color:#ae81ff>20</span>);
ages.Add(<span style=color:#ae81ff>30</span>);
ages.Add(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;Hey, I am not an age!&#34;</span>);
</code></pre></div><p>Our intention is to have only ages in this collection. But since ArrayList is weakly-typed, we inserted a value which is not an age. Here is a strongly-types version of this code.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-csharp data-lang=csharp>List&lt;<span style=color:#66d9ef>int</span>&gt; ages = <span style=color:#66d9ef>new</span> List&lt;<span style=color:#66d9ef>int</span>&gt;();
ages.Add(<span style=color:#ae81ff>10</span>);
ages.Add(<span style=color:#ae81ff>20</span>);
ages.Add(<span style=color:#ae81ff>30</span>);
ages.Add(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;I am not an age&#34;</span>); <span style=color:#75715e>// &lt;- compiler error here
</span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Q) What is a PID? How is it useful when troubleshooting a system?</strong></p><p>PID is Process Identifier and used by operating system to identify processes uniquely. I am not sure how it is used for troubleshooting. If some can provide insights into this, I will update this area.</p><p><strong>Q) How many processes can listen on a single TCP/IP port?</strong></p><p>Only one.</p><p><strong>Q) What is the GAC? What problem does it solve?</strong></p><p>GAC stands for Global Assembly Cache. It provides a centralized storage for assemblies that needs to be shared across applications. It solved the versioning problem and allows side-by-side execution. It can be used when assemblies require elevated permission to do the job.</p></div></main></body></html>
