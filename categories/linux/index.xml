Here is what Wikipedia says about xargs
xargs is a command on Unix and most Unix-like operating systems used to build and execute command lines from standard input
Most common use of xargs would be to do something like,

I am still evaluating the technique and not yet concluded on whether I should continue using it.
To implement pomodoro technique, you need a kitchen timer or egg timer. Since I use pomodoro for my programming work, I obviously don’t want to use a physical timer. I couldn’t find a decent timer for linux especially one that works well with Xfce.</description></item></channel></rss>
