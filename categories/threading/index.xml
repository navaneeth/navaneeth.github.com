      <description>If you search for this topic, you will find lots of information and many of them claiming Thread.Sleep() is evil. However, I think this evilness is mostly dependent on which context Thread.Sleep() is used.
You might have seen code like the below one.
while (!exit) { DoWork(); Thread.Sleep(10000); }  This code example does some work and sleeps for 1 minute before does the job again. This simple example has some potential issues.</description>
